# General Purpose

This repository contains a LaTeX template for papers written by members of the research group. The structure is very basic and can/should be extended as necessary. Please note that this is a **template repository**: Instead of cloning it directly the preferred way of using this template is via the *use template* button in GitHub's web UI.

# Additional Features

Furthermore the repo contains a Makefile which provides the capability for simple cleanup via `make clean` and the possibility of creating *diffs* via `make diff`. Both require `make` to be installed on your system and the latter additionally requires `latexdiff`.
